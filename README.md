# Termgraph
A utility to display Directed-Graphs in the Terminal

## Motivation
This crate was born to allow for easy visualization of Graphs in the Terminal, either for debugging
purposes or for displaying it to the end user.
This was started as I could not find anothe crate that really suited my use-case and this might also
be useful for others when working with graphs in Rust, which can already be hard enough.
